LinkedIn is a job search engine. Let's keep it that way. 

# Background

When ocassionaly checking the gutter that LI feed is, I come accross with a lot of useless fluff in my feed which doesn't add any value to my searches and makes my life painful. 

This userscript attempts to hide all the posts which have not been written by my immediate contacts on LI. 
(i.e: Paul finds this useful, or, Nicholas celebrates this, or, Andrea likes this... well, you get the idea).

I also don't care about sponsored crap that LI tries to peddle to me. That goes away too. 

# Requirements

You need a browser extension capable of running user scripts. (i.e: [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or similar)
