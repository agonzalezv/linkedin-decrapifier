# linkedin-decrapifier

I don't care what people likes, celebrates, find insightful, etc on LinkedIn.

# Background

My awesome wife is looking for a job. I'm trying to be helpful so I'm checking linkedin posts to see what's going on. 
What's going on is a lot of fluff in my feed which doesn't add any value to my search and makes my life painful. 

This user script attempts to hide all the posts which have not been written by my immediate contacts on LinkedIn. 
(i.e: Paul finds this useful, or, Nicholas celebrates this, or, Andrea likes this... well, you get the idea).

# Requirements

You need a browser extension capable of running user scripts. (i.e: [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or similar)
